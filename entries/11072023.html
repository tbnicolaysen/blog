    <p> Also, and maybe more importantly, entry 1. Cheers to that. I've never really written a blog before. I feel like it would add <br>
    another learning opportunity to the already skyrocketing list of learning opportunities over this past month. So, to clarify:<br>
    Hi, I'm Trevor. I'm seeking to become a software engineer. Or at least something along those lines. One of the engineers<br>
    at my workplace recommended I try The Odin Project and here I am a few weeks later. Its not going quite as fast as <br>
    I was hoping for, but life sometimes slows down goals, and my goal was to hit the ground sprinting. Running isn't <br>
    too bad though.<br>
    <br>
    So far I've been taught the basics of Git and Github. I can pull from my repository, add, commit, commit messages, and push. <br>
    Really what I can only assume are the bread and butter of an overwhelmingly rich sandwich that I wouldn't be able to <br>
    stomach yet. On that note I forgot to push my project last night. Oopsie.<br>
    <br>
    Its been a fairly easy journey so far. I think I'm pretty consistent at the basics, but I'm just sitting here in html. I<br>
    haven't really done more than type a few &lt;p&gt;s and &lt;/p&gt;s. Which I JUST had to look up how to do in html without it<br>
    becoming a tag. I think more than anything, I'm having a surprising amount of fun this time. With little experiments like that,<br>
    and things like wondering how certain tags interact and being free to just try it out: there is a different personal sense of<br>
    satisfaction that I never got from trying to use a hyperordered specialized environment like when I tried codecademy. I'll be<br>
    trying to keep this updated at least two or three times a week. I want to be able to process my thoughts to engage with and<br>
    reinforce what I've learned. If I ever toss this on a site, I'm always interested in thoughts or recommendations from<br>
    people in the field so feel free to give input or ask questions. Tomorrow I start CSS, and I've heard people <br>
    pointedly not tell stories about that, so wish me luck!</p>
